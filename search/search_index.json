So when you are making your rules, keep that in mind. This can be useful in a large library where your first rule could potentially match to a lot of items. It is advisable to put this rule at the end of the section. One example could be a rule that is like this:</p> <p>Don't do :</p> <pre><code>flowchart LR\nA(Does it have zero views?)--AND--&gt;B(Is it older than 3 years?)\n B --AND--&gt;C(Does it not include the Radarr tag *save* ?)</code></pre> <p>This example is going to have a lot of results for the <code>zero views</code> rule (potentially 4k out of a 6k and above Movie library). It would be better in this instance to put the <code>zero views</code> criteria at the end. Due to the way Maintainerr runs the rules in order, its \"list\" from rule 1 could be everything that is <code>older than 3 years</code> (potentially only 2k out of the 6k plus movies), then we only have to sift through those 2k items to find the ones that have <code>zero views</code>.It could be even further reduced if say 300 of those have the <code>save</code> tag. We shaved off 2k movies that need to be checked for <code>zero views</code>. These numbers are made up, but this could possibly be the difference of a few hours in a rule execution, or worst case the rule crashes before completion.</p> <p>Do:</p> <pre><code>flowchart LR\nA(Is it older than 3 years?)--AND--&gt;B(Does it not include the Radarr tag *save* ?)\n B --AND--&gt;C(Does it have zero views?)</code></pre>"},{"location":"blog/tutorials/sections-s01e03/#example-4","title":"Example 4","text":"<p>This will be our last example/scenario of sections.</p> <pre><code>flowchart LR\nsubgraph Section1\nA(Was it added to Plex before 90 days?)\nend\nsubgraph Section 2\n B(Is it monitored in Radarr?)\nend\nsubgraph Section 3\n C(Was it requested by user_girl123?)\n end\nA-.AND.-&gt;B\nB-.AND.-&gt;C\nC ==&gt; D(Results)</code></pre> <p>This is the same thing as putting all of those rules in one section. <code>Section 1 results</code> AND <code>Section 2 results</code> AND <code>Section 3 results</code>.

Again, Maintainerr runs rules in order and makes \"list\". When <code>Rule 1</code> gets looked at, a \"list\" is created. When Rule 2 is an <code>AND</code> to Rule 1, Rule 2 criteria gets matched only to items in the Rule 1 \"list\". If Rule 2 was an <code>OR</code> to Rule 1, the entire library gets looked at again (during Rule 2) to see if anything matches its criteria. This \"list\" gets added to the Rule 1 list.</li> </ul> <p>Please send me an email at ydkmlt84@maintainerr.info for suggestions on what to cover in the next episode.</p>"},{"location":"blog/archive/2024/","title":"2024","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/tutorials/","title":"Tutorials","text":""}]}
