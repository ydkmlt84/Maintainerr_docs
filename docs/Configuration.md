| Param        | Description           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Hostname      | The hostname or IP of the host Maintainerr runs on |
| Api key       | Maintainerr's API key. Which has no use yet. |

## Media Server

### Plex

When using a local Plex instance, make sure your Plex's 'secure connections' network setting is set to 'preferred' instead of 'required'.
If you'd like Maintainerr to communicate securely, you'll have to use your '*.plex.direct' URL as the hostname. You can copy this URL from Seerr's configuration. Make sure you include 'https://'.

| Param        | Description           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Name          | The name of your server |
| Hostname or IP| The domain name or local IP of the host your server runs on |
| Port          | The port Plex runs on, default is 32400 |
| Authentication| Authenticate with your Plex server using an **admin** account |

!!! tip
    The typical flow is to Authenticate with Plex -> click on the refresh icon -> choose your server from the dropdown menu -> click on Save Changes -> click on Test Saved.

### Jellyfin

Jellyfin uses API keys for authentication. You'll need to select an admin user for full access.

| Param        | Description           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Hostname or IP| The domain name or local IP of your Jellyfin server (e.g., `http://192.168.1.10`) |
| Port          | The port Jellyfin runs on, default is 8096 |
| API Key       | API key from Jellyfin settings (Dashboard > API Keys) |
| Admin User    | Select an admin user from the dropdown |

!!! warning "Admin User Required"
    API key authentication doesn't provide a user context. An admin user is needed for:
    
    - Watch history across all users
    - Access to all libraries
    - Collection management

!!! tip
    Enter URL and port -> Add API key -> Test connection -> Select admin user from dropdown -> Save Changes.
