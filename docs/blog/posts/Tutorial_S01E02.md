**Let's go a little further into Rules with some simple examples to get you started.**

In episode 1 we went over a super basic outline of rules and sections, operators, and general rule setup. In today's episode we will go over some simple rules examples. You could setup a few AND rules and roll with it, but then you wouldn't be using Maintainerr to its full potential. This episode should give you a good base of rule knowledge to build off of.

Let's bring back the Movie from episode 1, that we wanted to add into our new collection.

This movie has the following attributes across Plex, OverSeerr, and Radar:

**Plex** -

| Added | Last Viewed | Times Viewed | Audience Rating |
| -------|-------------|--------------|---------------- |
| 3Nov2023 | 10Jan2024 | 4 | 7.3 |

**OverSeerr** -

| Requested by | Requested Date | Times Requested by Anyone|
| ------------| --------------- | ------------- |
| user_girl123 | 2Nov2023 | 4 |

**Radarr** -

| Release Date | Is Monitored | Runtime |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------- |
| 31Oct2023 | True | 114 minutes |

With this information, we have quite a few options that we can use as rule parameters/filters.

# Examples

## Simple Rule

- 1: We can use one rule that states `Plex-Date Added` `before` `amount of days` `60`.
  - This will match in our special tutorial scenario because the day the Movie was added to Plex happened 60 days or more "before" today's date.
- 2: We could use a rule that states `Plex-Times Viewed` `bigger` `number` `3`.
  - This would get added because it has a *Times Viewed* value of 4, which is bigger than 3.
- 3: We could also use a rule that states `Plex-Audience Rating (scale 1-10)` `bigger` `number` `5`.
  - This rule would catch our movie because it's *Audience Rating* is 7.3. Which is bigger than 5.

## Simple AND

- 1: We could add Rule 1 that states `Plex-Date Added` `before` `amount of days` `60`. Rule 2 that states AND `Plex-Times Viewed` `bigger` `number` `5`.
  - This would not catch our movie because it has a *Times Viewed* value of 4 and we need it to match <font color=yellow> (rule 1 AND rule 2)</font>. It does match rule 1 but it does not match rule 2. If another movie in the library was added 60 days ago or more **AND** it had a view count of more than 5. It **WOULD** get added to this rule.
</br>  

**Let's try one more.**

- 2: Rule 1 states `Plex-Times Viewed` `bigger` `number` `3`. Rule 2 states AND `Overseerr-Amount of Requests` `equals` `Plex-Times Viewed`.
  - This rule-set **WOULD** add our movie because it's *Times Viewed* amount is 4 (bigger than 3), **AND** the *Amount of Requests*(4) from Overseerr **EQUALS** the *Times Viewed*(4) amount from Plex. <font color=yellow>(Rule1 AND Rule2)</font>

Those are some fairly simple AND examples, and hopefully it is starting to become obvious what is going on. Within a *section*, and only using AND operators, each item also needs to match the rule before it to be counted as a match and added to the collection.

Another way to look at these examples, is that within a *section*, each rule is making a list. The next rule is checking that list to see if anything ALSO has that value, plus the value of it's own rule.

### Visual Example

 ```mermaid
 graph LR
 title:>Rule-set: Rule1 AND Rule2]
    A([Has it been viewed in Plex more than 3 times?]) -->|Yes|B([AND is it monitored in Radarr?])
    B -->|Yes| C([Add it to the collection])
    B -->|No| D([Don't add to the collection.])
 ```

## Simple OR

We don't have to go too far in-depth with this because of what we have already learned. We will just give a quick example, then a visual.

- 1: We can use one rule that states `Plex-Date Added` `before` `amount of days` `90`.
  - This will not match in our special tutorial scenario because the day the Movie was added to Plex happened only *60* days BEFORE today's date. Not quite *90* days yet.
- 2: Our next rule states OR `Overseerr-Requested by user (Plex or local username)` `Contains (Partial list match)` `text` `user_girl123`.
  - This would match because as we can see, that is who requested the movie.
- 3: This rule-set **WOULD** add our movie because it meets one **OR** the other of our criteria. It was added *60* days ago so it does not meet our criteria of *BEFORE* *90* days, AKA the day it was added has not yet been 90 days *BEFORE* today's date. It did however match the Overseerr requested by user rule. It gets added because we said we wanted <font color=yellow>(Rule 1 OR Rule 2)</font>.
Now let's get a visual.

### Visual Example

``` mermaid
graph LR
title:>Rule-set: Rule1 OR Rule2]
A([Was it added to Plex before 90 days?]) -->|No|B([Did it match one OR the other]);
 C([Was it requested by user_girl123]) -->|Yes|B;
 B -->|Yes|D([Add it to the collection]); 
```

Again, I hope this is starting to come together. In our next episode we will be going over the use of sections and when they can be useful. Stay tuned.
