???+ note "Beta Feature"

## Overview

The notification system works by connecting configured notification agents to your rules. When specific events occur (such as media being added to or removed from collections), Maintainerr will send notifications to the configured agents that are subscribed to those event types.

3. Select which configured notification agents should receive alerts for this rule
4. Save the rule configuration

## Testing Notifications

You can test any configured notification agent by:

1. Going to **Settings → Notifications**
2. Editing an existing notification configuration
3. Clicking the **Test** button
4. A test notification will be sent to verify the configuration is working

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Notifications not sending**: Verify the agent is enabled and the connection settings are correct
- **Missing notifications**: Check that the notification agent is connected to the relevant rules

### Log Information

Notification activities are logged in the Maintainerr logs. Check the logs for any error messages or delivery confirmations if notifications aren't working as expected.
