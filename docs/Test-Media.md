# Test Media

Maintainerr comes with a built-in feature to test your ruleset against your media, and display the results to you. This can be done without ever running a rule or creating collections in Plex. Sometimes, it is hard for you to determine why something was or wasn't added to a collection. Using the Test Media feature can be an extremely useful tool in helping you figure out what is going on.

## Test Media button

The first thing you must do, in order to use this function, is to create a rule. More on that can be found in the Rules documentation, as well as in the Walkthroughs.
