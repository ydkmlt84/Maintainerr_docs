<b>[Maintainerr](https://maintainerr.info)</b> makes managing your media easy.

- Do you hate being the janitor of your server?
- Do you have a lot of media that never gets watched?
- Do your users constantly request media, and let it sit there afterward never to be touched again?

If you answered yes to any of those questions.. You NEED <b>[Maintainerr](https://maintainerr.info)</b>.
It's a one-stop-shop for handling those outlying shows and movies that take up precious space on your server.

This repo exists solely for the documentation of **Maintainerr**.

# The "Docs"
- These docs are made using the lovely [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) project. 

- Roughly 95% percent of the documentation is written using the markdown syntax. 

- There is a ton of documentation out there for markdown but this one is my favorite. -> [MarkdownGuide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).


# Contributing

The docs website itself runs on a Material for Mkdocs docker container, and is self hosted. It also uses the *Insiders* edition of the previously mentioned project. 

If you would like to add anything to the docs, especially a guide/tutorial, please feel free to make a PR on Github. You can see the structure of the site in the repo directory.

There are a TON of options in the Material for Mkdocs project, and they are outlined here -> [Getting Started](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/). If you want to include something that is an ***insiders only*** option, you can do that and I will take a look on my end. You will have to purchase it though, if you want to test it before pushing your PR.

# Credits

I have personally added and tweaked some things here, but thanks goes out the Maintainerr dev who made the wise decision to document his work.
